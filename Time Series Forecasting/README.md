# This project demonstrates the sales forecasting of Alcohol using LSTM. 

## The Key Tools I used:
1. MinMaxScaler from sklearn
2. LSTM from Pytorch

## The Key Achievement: 
1. Developed a Deep Neural Network model using Pytorch (LSTM) to forecast alcohol sales.
2. Achieving a 99.9% mean square error (MSE) improvement.
