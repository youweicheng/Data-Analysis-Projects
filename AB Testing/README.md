# This project demonstrates A/B Testing of Two Campaigns. 

## The Key Tools I used:
1. Matplotlib
2. Seaborn
3. Scipy

## The Key Achievement: 
**Conclusion**

1. Effectiveness: The test campaign significantly outperformed the control campaign\
in terms of both conversion rate and click-through rate. This indicates that the new\
campaign strategy was more effective at engaging users and driving conversions. 

2. Efficiency: Despite the substantial improvements in conversion rate and CTR,\
the test campaign did not significantly increase the cost per conversion.\
This suggests that the new strategy improved performance without sacrificing cost efficiency.

3. Consistency: The improvements were consistent across both mean and median measures,\
reinforcing the robustness of the results.

4. Magnitude of Improvement: The size of the improvements (68%-101% for CTR, 45%-69% for conversion rate)\
is substantial and likely to have a meaningful impact on overall marketing performance.

5. Statistical Validity: The use of approproate statistical tests, considering normality and homogeneity,\
adds condifence to these conclusions.

**Recommedndation**

Based on these results, implementing the test campaign strategy is strongly recommended.\
It demonstrates significant improvements in key perfromance metrics without increasing much costs,\
indicating a more effective and efficient marketing approach.

**Next Steps**

1. Gradually roll out the new campaign strategy to a larger audience.
2. Continue monitoring performance to ensure the improvements are sustained over time.
3. Analyze the specific elements of the test campaign that may have contribured to\
its success, to inform future campaign designs.
4. Consider running follow-up tests to further optimize the campaign parameters.

**This comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence for the superiority of the test campaign,offering a clear direction for improving marketing performance.**
